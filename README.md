# Image-Classification
Image classification is a core task in computer vision, where the goal is to categorize an image into a predefined class. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for this task due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers.

CNN Structure:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features using filters that scan the image.
Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps, reducing dimensionality.
Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification based on learned features.
Output Layer: Typically uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Advantages:
CNNs reduce manual feature extraction by automatically learning features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
They are robust in handling large datasets like ImageNet, offering high accuracy for complex image recognition tasks.

Process:
Input image is passed through a series of convolution and pooling layers to extract features.
Flattening transforms the 2D matrix into a vector.
Fully connected layers map the features to class scores.
A softmax function assigns a probability to each class, predicting the most likely one.

CNNs excel in tasks like object recognition, medical image analysis, and facial recognition due to their power in understanding complex visual patterns.
